## My process
I used vite React for this project. Used tailwind CSS for the styilng part. I have not used any lib for the email validation, Insead i used useState because there is not much to it. I made this website with mobile first approach. It is a simple and fun project. I thank frontend mentor for providing us such exercises for free to develop our skills. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- gh Pages
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to validate an input for email, name etc...
I learned how to implement a modal in React JS

### Continued development

- I want to develop my skills for making the website more responsive. 
- I am not sure about is this the good or standard way to display the model as I have done in this project!. I don't think using ternary operator to display the main content and model is a good way. 
-I need to improve my code readablity so other people can understand an use my code. 
-I also did used git from the first stage onwards which is a negative point i think, I will make sure to commit my changes from the starting onwards in my next project   

### Useful resources

- [Form validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfWJLK6S1Ec&t=1059s) - This helped me with email validation part. I understood how to validate if the given string is a email or not.
